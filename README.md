## Acknowledgments

The **Makefile** and **CMakeLists.txt** files were created with assistance from ChatGPT. Additionally, certain parts of the game logic were optimized with ChatGPTâ€™s guidance, leveraging integrated C++ methods such as **std::any_of**, **std::find_if**, and **std::strftime** for improved performance and efficiency.
