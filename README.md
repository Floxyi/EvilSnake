git clone https://github.com/Floxyi/EvilSnake.git
cd EvilSnake
```

### Run & Build the Project

- You can compile and run the game:

```bash
make run
```

- You can build the game for macOS:

```bash
make build-macos
```

- (Optional) You can export compiler commands for use with LSPs:

cd build/
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..
```

- If you need to clean the build directories:

```bash
make clean
```

The **Makefile** and **CMakeLists.txt** files were created with assistance from ChatGPT. Additionally, a few small parts of the game logic were optimized afterwards with ChatGPTâ€™s guidance for improved performance and efficiency.
